","In a small pan, melt the rest of the butter over a gentle heat and set aside.","Place the sugar in a metal bowl and sit it over a pan of simmering water, checking that the base of the bowl is not touching the water. Break the eggs into the bowl, and with an electric hand mixer beat the mixture over the simmering water for 1-3 minutes, until it becomes pale and frothy. Remove the metal bowl from the heat and continue to beat the mixture for a further two minutes while it cools.","Gently stir in the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. With a metal spoon, carefully fold in the sifted flour and cocoa powder. Slowly trickle in the melted butter and continue to combine gently.","Pour the mixture into the greased tin and bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the centre is firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and cool a little in the tin. Drizzle the whisky over the sponge and set aside to cool completely in the tin.","To make the honeycomb, line a 20cm/8in square cake tin with baking parchment. In a large heavy-based saucepan, heat the golden syrup and sugar together and bring to the boil, then simmer on a low heat for 5–10 minutes. The mixture will bubble and darken to a golden caramel, but be careful not to let it get too dark or the flavour will be bitter. ","Stir in the cardamom and remove the pan from heat. Immediately – but carefully – add the bicarbonate of soda and mix it in; the mixture will instantly foam up significantly, which is why a large pan is needed to prepare the syrup. Pour immediately into the lined cake tin. Leave to set for at least an hour, then peel off the paper and break the honeycomb into bite-sized chunks. The honeycomb will stay crisp in a dry, airtight container for a day or two, but will gradually soften over time.","To make the chocolate torte, put the chopped chocolate into a large heatproof bowl and set aside. ","Pour 200ml/7fl oz water into a pan, add the ground cardamom and sugar, and bring to the boil, stirring. When just boiling remove from the heat and cool for 30 seconds. Pour through a very fine strainer over the chocolate, stirring continuously to form a smooth glossy mixture. Discard the contents of the strainer.

Don’t leave it for much longer than this or it will be difficult to get out of the bowl to shape.","Unroll and slice off two large pieces of cling film, overlapping them, so that you have a large cling-covered surface to roll the chocolate salame out on. Tip the chocolate mixture out in the middle of this and – using your hands, messy though this is – mould the mixture into a fat salame-like log, approximately 30cm/12in long.","Cover the chocolate log completely with the cling film, and then firmly roll it, as if it were a rolling pin, to create a smooth, rounded cylinder from the rough log you started with. Twist the ends by grasping both ends of the cling film and rolling the sausage-log towards you several times. Then put it in the fridge for at least six hours – though preferably overnight – to set.","Now – one it’s set – for the exciting bit: tear off a large piece of greaseproof paper and lay it on a clear kitchen surface. Take the salame out of the fridge and sit it on the paper. Measure out a piece of string at least six times longer than the length of the salame, and tie one end of the string firmly round the twisted knot of cling film at one end of the salame. Then trim away as much cling film as you can, but without cutting either of the tapered, nose ends, so that you can attach the string to these.","Dust your hands with a little icing sugar and then rub two tablespoons of icing sugar (more if needed) over the unwrapped salame to stop it getting sticky as you string it up. Plus it makes it look more like a salame.","Make a loop with the string, a little wider than the salame, and feed it over the end of the salame, close to where it is tied on. Pull on the trailing end to tighten (but not too tightly) and form another loop of string as before. Work this second loop around the sausage, 4cm or so further along from the first, tighten again and repeat until you reach the far end of the salame, then tie the string firmly round the other twisted nose of cling film.","With your remaining length of string, start to feed it back along the salame, twisting it around the encircling string each time it crosses a loop, then tie it again when you come to the end. Repeat these lengths as many times as you want, to make the authentic-looking pattern, but two or three times would be enough to get the effect.","Transfer it to a wooden board, and cut some slices, fanning them out as if they were indeed slices of salame, leaving a knife on the board, too, for people to cut further slices, as they wish. Obviously, when you cut the salame, you will need to cut through the string, but the many knots and twists keep it securely tied.

Using a small sharp knife cut a straight edge along one length and cut the other into a silhouette of rooftops – making sure it is no deeper than the height of the cake. Keep any offcuts to use to make Santa and his reindeer later. Brush the sides of the cake with the diluted agave syrup and stick the black fondant rooftops to it (to make this easier, cut the strip into smaller pieces that are easier to handle).","Reroll the offcuts and carefully cut out a silhouette of Santa and his reindeer (make this easier by printing a suitably-sized image from the internet, placing it over the fondant and using a pin to mark the out the edges). ","Roll out the white fondant and use a large biscuit cutter to cut into a neat circle. This will make the moon on the top of the cake. Wet the back of the black fondant Santa and place on top of the cake going across the fondant moon.","For the royal icing, beat the icing sugar and a tablespoon of water together until thick and smooth, adding extra water if necessary.

Preheat the oven to 140C/275F/Gas 1.","Measure the butter, sugar, eggs, treacle and almonds into a very large bowl and beat well (preferably with an electric free-standing mixer). Add the flour and ground spice and mix thoroughly until blended. Stir in the soaked fruit. Spoon into the prepared cake tin and level the surface. ","Bake in the centre of the preheated oven for about 4-4½ hours, or until the cake feels firm to the touch and is a rich golden brown. Check after two hours, and if the cake is a perfect colour, cover with foil. A skewer inserted into the centre of the cake should come out clean.

Wrap the completely cold cake in a double layer of greaseproof paper and again in foil and store in a cool place for up to three months, feeding at intervals with more brandy. (Don’t remove the lining paper when storing as this helps to keep the cake moist.)","The week before you want to serve, begin covering the cake.","For the covering, stand the cake upside down, flat side uppermost, on a cake board which is 5cm/2in larger than the size of the cake.","Brush the sides and the top of the cake with the warm apricot jam. ","Liberally dust a work surface with icing sugar and then roll out the marzipan to about 5cm/2in larger than the surface of the cake.

","Carefully lift the marzipan over the cake using a rolling pin. Gently level and smooth the top of the paste with the rolling pin, then ease the marzipan down the sides of the cake, smoothing it at the same time.

Cover the cake loosely with baking parchment and leave for a few days to dry out before adding the royal icing. ","For the royal icing, whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until they become frothy.

","Turn out the dough onto a clean work surface (there’s no need to put flour or oil onto the surface because it’s a tight rather than sticky dough).","Knead the dough to combine the ingredients properly. Use the heel of your hand to stretch the dough. Roll it back up into a ball, then turn it, stretch and roll it up again. Repeat this process for about 5-6 minutes.

{"ingredients":["110g/4oz plain flour, sifted","pinch of salt","2 eggs","200ml/7fl oz milk mixed with 75ml/3fl oz water","50g/2oz butter","1 medium orange, grated zest only","1 tbsp caster sugar ","150ml/5fl oz orange juice (from 3-4 medium oranges)","1 medium orange, grated zest only","1 small lemon, grated rind and juice","1 tbsp caster sugar","3 tbsp Grand Marnier, Cointreau or brandy","50g/2oz unsalted butter","a little extra Grand Marnier, for flaming"],"method":["Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl with a sieve held high above the bowl so the flour gets an airing. Now make a well in the centre of the flour and break the eggs into it. Then begin whisking the eggs - any sort of whisk or even a fork will do - incorporating any bits of flour from around the edge of the bowl as you do so.","Next gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture, still whisking (don't worry about any lumps as they will eventually disappear as you whisk). When all the liquid has been added, use a rubber spatula to scrape any elusive bits of flour from around the edge into the centre, then whisk once more until the batter is smooth, with the consistency of thin cream. Now melt the 50g/2oz of butter in a pan. Spoon 2 tbsp of it into the batter and whisk it in, then pour the rest into a bowl and use it to lubricate the pan, using a wodge of kitchen paper to smear it round before you make each pancake. Stir the orange zest and caster sugar into the batter.","Now get the pan really hot, then turn the heat down to medium and, to start with, do a test pancake to see if you're using the correct amount of batter. These little crêpes should be thinner than the basic pancakes, so when you're making them, use ½ tbsp of batter at a time in a 18cm/7in pan. It's also helpful if you spoon the batter into a ladle so it can be poured into the hot pan in one go. As soon as the batter hits the hot pan, tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter. It should take only half a minute or so to cook; you can lift the edge with a palette knife to see if it's tinged gold as it should be. Flip the pancake over with a pan slice or palette knife - the other side will need a few seconds only - then simply slide it out of the pan onto a plate. If the pancakes look a little bit ragged in the pan, no matter because they are going to be folded anyway. You should end up with 15-16 crêpes.","Stack the pancakes as you make them between sheets of greaseproof paper on a plate fitted over simmering water, to keep them warm while you make the rest.","For the sauce, mix all the ingredients - with the exception of the butter - in a bowl. At the same time warm the plates on which the crêpes are going to be served. Now melt the butter in the frying pan, pour in the sauce and allow it to heat very gently. Then place the first crêpes in the pan and give it time to warm through before folding it in half and then in half again to make a triangular shape. Slide this onto the very edge of the pan, tilt the pan slightly so the sauce runs back into the centre, then add the next crêpe. Continue like this until they're all re-heated, folded and well soaked with the sauce.","You can flame them at this point if you like. Heat a ladle by holding it over a gas flame or by resting it on the edge of a hotplate, then, away from the heat, pour a little liqueur or brandy into it, return it to the heat to warm the spirit, then set light to it.

Line two large baking trays with parchment paper and set aside.","Heat a large frying pan (without any oil in it) over a medium heat and toast the coconut for a few minutes until golden-brown and toasty. Tip into a bowl and set aside. ","Meringues can be made by hand but it does take a long time. Using a hand whisk or a freestanding mixer makes the whole thing far more enjoyable. Put the sugar and one of the egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk for about 30 seconds on a high speed. Add another egg white and whisk for about two minutes more. The mixture will start to become quite thick. Add the remaining egg whites, one at a time beating really well between each addition. Whisk until the mixture is really, really stiff, white and shiny. It should become so stiff that if you turned the bowl upside down the meringue would not come out! It does take slightly longer to whisk it this way and it is a backward way of making meringues but the beauty of it is you cannot over-whisk this mixture even if you went off and left it for 15 minutes or so, so this method seems to work well for me! Finally, gently fold in the coconut until well combined. ","Using a large spoon, scoop the mixture into a piping bag which has been fitted with a 1½cm/¾in plain nozzle. Pipe out 48 blobs spaced apart on the baking trays with each one measuring 3-4cm/1¼-1½in wide and with a little peak on the top (to be about 2cm/¾in in height). Bake for around 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the meringues are crisp on the outside but still a little soft on the inside. Swap the trays around on the shelves half way through the cooking time to ensure even cooking.","When the meringues are cooked, take them out of the oven and set aside to cool down. As they cool, make the ginger filly Chantilly. Mix all of the ingredients, except the strawberries, together well in a bowl and spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 1½cm/¾in plain nozzle. Pop into the fridge until ready to assemble.","Once the meringues are completely cool, pipe a small blob of the ginger filly on the bottom of two meringue pieces. Place a slice of strawberry on one of the filly Chantillys and then sandwich it together with the other meringue. Repeat with the remaining meringues and filling to make 24 in total, arranging them on a large platter as you go. Serve straight away.

If the dough springs back all the way, then the dough is ready, if it only springs back a little, then knead it for a couple more minutes and try again. ","Now flatten the bread ball out a little (to give roughly a 5cmx12.5cm/2inx5in wide loaf). Then pull the edges into the middle giving a little parcel type thing and turn it over.

Cut the pastry into two 13cm/5in discs using a chef's ring or a small plate and place on the lined baking sheet. Transfer to the fridge, or ideally the freezer, for at least 1 hour, to prevent the pastry being sticky.","Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.","To prepare the beetroot, cut the root off each one. Using a mandolin set to a thickness of 1mm, slice into thin discs and transfer to a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the warm butter to ensure each slice of beetroot is evenly coated.","To cook the beetroot, place a 9cm/3½in metal ring in a 12cm/4½in blini pan. Layer the seasoned beetroot discs inside the ring in a rosace pattern 3 layers deep. The metal ring will facilitate the building of the beetroot and keep it upright and in a perfect circle. Repeat this with the other blini pan and metal ring. Cut a circle of baking paper to the same size as the blini pan.","Lift the metal ring off the beetroot and lay the baking paper on top of the beetroot rosace, then press the ring back over the rosace. (By placing the ring over the paper you will trap the steam trying to escape, which will keep the beetroot beautifully moist.) Cook the beetroot rosaces on a medium heat for 2 minutes, until the sides start to bubble. Some juices from the beetroot will boil in the pan – this is important as it speeds up the cooking of the beetroot in the oven and gives a nice light caramelisation to the beetroot.","Transfer the beetroot to the oven for 10–12 minutes. Remove from the oven, leave to rest and cool completely. Lift off the rings and greaseproof paper from the cooled beetroot rosaces and turn them out on to a small plate (the coloured side, with its golden rosace pattern will be facing upwards). Set aside. ","For the onion jam, in a saucepan over a medium heat, melt the butter and add the onion, salt and pepper. Cook for 35–40 minutes, covered with a lid, until softened but not caramelised. Stir every 5 minutes to prevent the onions from burning. Deglaze the pan with the vinegar, scraping any browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon, and boil for 20 seconds. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Leave to cool completely. ","To build and cook the beetroot tarts, divide the onion jam equally between the two pastry discs and with the back of a spoon spread the onions to a thin layer leaving a gap of 1cm/½in around the edge. Lightly brush the pastry edges with a thin coating of egg wash and sprinkle them with the black pepper and powdered orange and thyme, if using. Using a palette knife, lift each golden rosace into the centre of each pastry base. Place a piece of baking parchment over each of the tarts and place a cooling rack on top of them. Transfer to the oven for 20 minutes, or until the sides of the pastry are golden-brown. The parchment paper and cooling rack on the tarts help keep the moisture in the beetroot; it will also ensure the pastry rises evenly and the beetroot slices do not curl whilst cooking. ","To make the Jerez vinaigrette, mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. ","To serve, dress the leaves with half the vinaigrette and arrange on each plate. Scatter the cottage cheese over the salad.

Have ready a 4cm/1½in deep, 20cm/8in pastry ring or cake tin. ","For the oat biscuit base, in a large bowl combine the flours, butter, bicarbonate of soda, sugar and salt. Using your fingertips, rub the ingredients together until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the oats and egg and mix well. Knead until it comes together. ","Using a rolling pin, roll the biscuit mixture out between two sheets of baking parchment to a thickness of 5mm/¼in. Lift onto a baking tray and remove the top piece of paper. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes. ","Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 2 minutes. Using the 20cm/8in pastry ring or cake tin, press down into the biscuit, cutting through the bottom. Leave to cool completely before using for the cheesecake. Remove the excess biscuit from around the ring; this can be crumbled on top of the finished cheesecake, if wished. ","For the filling, in a large bowl mix the cream cheese, crème fraîche, vanilla purée or extract and lemon juice together. ","Place the gelatine in a small saucepan with 2 teaspoons water and heat gently until the gelatine is dissolved. Once slightly cool, briskly whisk into the cream mixture. In a small saucepan dissolve the sugar in 5 teaspoons water. Bring to a boil and continue to heat to 121C on a sugar thermometer. (CAUTION: boiling sugar is very hot. Take care not to burn yourself.)","Meanwhile, in a food mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or using an electric hand whisk and a bowl, whisk the egg whites, adding just a single drop of lemon juice at the beginning. Whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. ","Turn the whisk to a medium speed and prepare to add the hot sugar syrup. The best technique for making this kind of Italian meringue is to pour the hot sugar syrup down the side of the bowl in a single thread so that it mixes beautifully. Otherwise the speed of the whisk will spin the sugar and solidify it over the whisk and bowl. Continue to whisk on a medium speed for a further 5 minutes until the mixture is glossy – the hot syrup will partially cook the egg white making it stable. ","Rest the base of the bowl of meringue in a bowl of ice-cold water and continue to whisk by hand until the mixture is completely cool. When cool, add half the egg whites to the cream filling mixture and briskly beat with a whisk until smooth, then add the remaining egg whites and fold together. ","Place the pastry ring or cake tin with the biscuit base inside on a baking tray or plate. Pour the filling into the ring, leaving a gap of 5mm/¼in from the top of the ring and level the surface flat using a palette knife or the back of a spoon. Refrigerate for 2 hours to allow the mixture to firm up. ","When the cheesecake has chilled for 1½ hours, make the gooseberry jelly. Put the gooseberries in a bowl and macerate with the sugar for 15 minutes. Transfer to a small saucepan over a medium heat and simmer for 10 minutes, covered with a lid. Pour into a blender, with the softened gelatine and 50g/1¾oz water and blend on full speed for a minute. To make sure the purée is smooth, pass it through a fine sieve into a bowl, forcing it through using the back of a ladle. Rest the base of the bowl over a bowl of ice-cold water to cool, stirring all the time. Once the mixture starts to thicken, spoon it over the chilled cheesecake. ","For the topping, top and tail the gooseberries and cut each one crossways into slices 2mm thick. Arrange 16 slices of gooseberries around the edge of the cheesecake on top of the jelly. Chill the cheesecake overnight or until set completely. ","For the compôte, cut the gooseberries in half. Taste one – if sweet enough, there is no need to macerate them, if they are a little sour, put in a mixing bowl with the sugar and leave to macerate for 15 minutes. ","Transfer to a saucepan on a medium heat and cook for 10 minutes with a lid on, stewing them at a gentle bubble; stir from time to time to prevent the compôte catching on the bottom of the pan. Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely, taste and adjust with a splash of water if it’s too acidic or a little sugar, if needed.
