Mix the water and lemon juice together in a jug and pour it into the flour and butter mixture.","Chop the butter into the flour, until the dough comes together. When the dough has formed a loose lump, tip it onto a lightly floured work surface and shape it into a thick rectangle. Roll the dough out, then fold one-third of the dough to the centre, then fold the other third over that. Roll the pastry out again to the same proportions as before and fold in the same way as before. Rotate the pastry a quarter turn and repeat the rolling and folding. Continue for another 3-4 more times.

Remove the pastry from the fridge and roll out until it’s the thickness of a pound coin. Use a 30cm/12in flan ring to cut the pastry to shape. Using a large circular nozzle, pipe some large choux buns around the edge of the puff pastry (approximately 10). On the greased baking tray, pipe out approximately 20 small choux buns. Place the pastry and choux buns into the oven for 25 minutes. ","For the crème pâtissière, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl until pale and light, then fold in the vanilla seeds and cornflour. Bring the milk to the boil in a small saucepan and then whisk it gradually into the egg mixture. Pour the mixture into a clean pan and bring it slowly to the boil until it thickens. Stir in the butter and simmer for a minute and then remove the pan from the heat.","For the passionfruit curd, in a food processor blend the passionfruit pulp and sieve into a heatproof bowl. If you are using a microwavem, whisk in the whole eggs, egg yolks and sugar. Stir in the butter and place the bowl in a microwave on a medium temperature for two minutes. Whisk, then return to the microwave for two more minutes. Whisk again, then return to the microwave for a final minute. By now the curd should be thick and smooth. If you don’t have a microwave, beat the eggs, egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl. Melt the butter over a low heat in a heavy-based pan and add the egg mixture and blended passionfruit. Cook gently, stirring constantly until thickened. Pour into a shallow bowl, cover with cling film and place in the fridge to cool. ","When the puff pastry is cooked, remove from the oven and brush with the egg white. Cook for a further minute then set aside to cool. ","For the small choux buns, prick the undersides with the tip of a sharp knife and place back into the oven for five minutes to crisp up. Remove and set aside to cool. ","To make the crème Chantilly, whip the cream until thickened using a handheld electric beater and add the vanilla seeds and icing sugar. Place in the fridge in a large mixing bowl. ","Spoon the crème Chantilly into a piping bag fitted with the large star nozzle. Pipe into the choux buns by inserting the nozzle into the cut made earlier. ","Once the choux buns are filled, make the caramel.  In a medium pan set over a high heat, add the sugar and 100ml/3½fl oz water and melt to an amber caramel. Remove from the heat and, using tongs, dip the choux buns into the caramel and place the choux buns into the middle of the gâteau, ensuring some room is left for the cream, chocolate ganache and curd to go on top. ","To make the ganache, in a heat proof jug melt the chocolate and cream in a microwave on a low setting. Allow to cool slightly, then pour into the centre of the gâteau. Spread the passionfruit curd over the top. ","To decorate, pipe the crème Chantilly in the centre of the gâteau, and into any gaps between the choux buns. Place the strawberries in a ring around the edge of the cream. ","To make the spun sugar decorations, in a pan set over a medium heat melt the sugar with two tablespoons of water until a caramel forms (it will be a deep amber colour).

{"ingredients":["300g/10½oz dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids) or milk chocolate","icing for piping Easter eggs "],"method":["Polish the inside of each mould with a piece of paper kitchen towel. Then dampen a piece of kitchen towel with a little flavourless oil, sunflower will do, and polish the inside of each mould with the oil. This ensures a highly polished finish to the chocolate and also helps to release the set chocolate from the mould.","It is essential to  temper  the chocolate - this is a method of heating and cooling chocolate for coating or moulding. The heating and cooling separates the cocoa solids and ensures the set chocolate will have a high gloss and smooth finish. To temper the chocolate you will need a cooking thermometer, a heat-proof bowl and saucepan of hot water. Break the chocolate into small, even pieces and melt gently in a bowl over a saucepan of hot, not boiling, water. Place the thermometer into the chocolate and heat until it reaches 43C/110F. Take off the heat and cool to 35C/95F. Now it is ready to use.","Pour spoonfuls of the chocolate into each mould. Swirl around until coated, use the pastry brush if necessary and then remove excess chocolate. Leave to set, flat side down on a surface, like a large tray, covered in greaseproof paper. Fill each mould in the same way. You will have to repeat the process another two or three times to build up a good layer of chocolate in each mould. Wait for about 20 minutes for the chocolate to set in between layers. Draw a clean ruler or the flat edge of a knife across the chocolate to ensure a clean edge every time you add a layer. This is important so that the two sides of the egg stick together evenly. Leave to chill in a larder or cool place until set.","Carefully un-mould the egg halves and place on a clean surface taking care not to handle the chocolate too much as it will start to melt from the heat of your hands.","To stick the two edges of an egg together, heat a baking sheet and then place the edges of two halves on it for a few seconds, then gently push the edges together.","To decorate the eggs, sit an egg in a glass or small cup and use as a stand while you pipe your desired message on the egg.

Roll out the pastry in one direction until it’s about 1cm thick and three times as long as it is wide, or about 45x15cm/18x6in. Straighten up the sides using your hands now and again, and try to keep the top and bottom edges as square as possible. ","Fold the bottom third of the pastry up, then the top third down, to make a block about 15x15cm/6x6in.

Press the edges of the pastry together using the rolling pin.","Roll out and fold the pastry again, repeating this four times in all to make a smooth dough, with buttery streaks here and there. If the pastry feels greasy at any point, or starts to spring back when as you roll, then cover and chill it for 10 minutes before continuing. Chill the finished pastry for an hour, or ideally overnight, before using.","For the filling, mix the beef with the flour and some salt and pepper. An easy way to do this without making too much mess is to put everything into a large food bag, seal, then shake well.","Heat a tablespoon of the oil in a large heatproof casserole up to a medium heat, then add half the beef, shaking off the excess flour and keeping the chunks well spaced so they fry rather than sweat. Brown for about 10 minutes, until golden-brown all over. ","Transfer the first batch of meat to a bowl, then add a splash of brown ale or water to the pan and scrape up any meaty bits. Tip the liquid into the bowl of meat. Wipe out the pan, then add a tablespoon of oil and brown the second batch of beef. When the beef is golden-brown transfer it to the bowl and set aside.","Add the final spoon of oil to the pan and heat gently. Add the garlic, onions, carrots, celery and herbs to the pan and fry for a few minutes, until softened.","Put the beef back into the pan. Pour in the stock and brown ale, then add the tomato purée and balsamic vinegar. If necessary, add a little more stock or hot water to ensure the meat is covered in liquid (this will prevent the beef from drying out). Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer the stew for 1–1½ hours until the beef is almost tender and the sauce has thickened. Set aside to cool, overnight if possible. ","Melt the butter in a large frying pan, then add the mushrooms. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then fry over a high heat for 5 minutes, or until golden-brown. Mix with the cooled pie filling and add to the pie dish. ","To make the pie, preheat the oven to 200C/Fan 180C/Gas 6.

Brush the edge of the pie dish with a little water or beaten egg.","Use a sharp knife to cut the pastry to fit the top of the dish – if it’s too big it doesn’t matter. Lift on top of the pie, laying the pastry over a rolling pin to lift it. Press down gently to seal. ","Holding the knife blade horizontally, make a patterned edge by pressing down gently all around the edge of the pastry (this will help the layers in the pastry to puff up). ","Cut a couple of slits in the top of the pie to release steam. Brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg – taking care to avoid getting egg on the edges of the pastry as it will stick the layers together. Chill for 10 minutes, or until the pastry is firm.

Push the paper into the tin and ease the paper into the corners neatly - they will overlap slightly. Trim if needed. ","Using a large sharp knife, chop the dark chocolate into small pieces (the smaller the pieces, the quicker it will melt). Place the chopped dark chocolate with the butter into a large mixing bowl that will sit on top of your pan of simmering water. ","Set the bowl over the pan of simmering water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Keep the heat low - the water should not be boiling furiously underneath, but quietly bubbling. After a few minutes the chocolate and butter will start to melt. Stir occasionally, until the chocolate is mostly melted. Remove the bowl from the pan and set aside. The residual heat in the chocolate will finish off the melting process.","While the chocolate is melting, chop the white (or white and milk) chocolate into bigger pieces - about the size of a penny. Set these aside.","Whisk the sugar into the melted chocolate, then add the eggs and whisk together well until the mix is slightly bubbly. ","Sift the flour, cocoa powder and the salt into a separate bowl.

","Gently pour the batter into the prepared tin, and scatter the remaining chunks of chocolate on top. Bake the brownies for 20-25 minutes. The brownies should still wobble slightly in the middle, as they will continue to cook for a little while when removed from the oven.

Put into the fridge to firm up while you make the cheesecake, roughly 30 mins - 1 hour.","Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. ","To separate the eggs, have three small bowls ready, preferably glass or ceramic. Gently crack the shell against the side of a small bowl. Slowly pull the shell apart as cleanly as possible along the crack, tipping the yolk into one half of the shell. Let the white drain away into the bowl below. Drop the yolk into another small bowl. Separate the next egg over a third bowl - that way if you accidentally break the yolk, it won’t contaminate the clean whites.  (The egg whites will keep for a week in the fridge, and can be whipped up to lighten pancakes.)","Slit the vanilla pod lengthwise, and scrape the seeds out with the blunt side of your knife. Scrape the seeds from your knife (or spoon the vanilla paste) into a large mixing bowl with the cream cheese. Beat the cheese and vanilla together with a wooden spoon or a hand-held mixer until smooth.","Add the sugar, then beat again till smooth.

","Turn the oven off, and let the cheesecake cool in the oven, with the door ajar. When cool, remove from the oven and chill thoroughly. Cooling the cheesecake slowly will help to prevent the top from cracking.","For strawberry sauce, put half of the strawberries into a food processor or blender, add the icing sugar then pulse until smooth.

Sweep a palette knife between the cake and the side of the tin, then carefully unclip the springform. Transfer the cheesecake to a serving plate.

{"ingredients":["a little sunflower oil, for greasing","225g/8oz butter, softened","225g/8oz caster sugar","4 free-range eggs","225g/8oz self-raising flour","200g/7oz white chocolate","200g/7oz butter, softened","400g/14oz icing sugar","2 lemons, finely grated zest only ","1 lime, finely grated zest only","250g/9oz mango, diced (approximately 2 medium mangoes)","2 tsp desiccated coconut, toasted","1 lime, finely grated zest only (optional)"],"method":["Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 (160C fan).  Grease two 18cm/7in loose bottomed, square sandwich tins with a little oil and then line with baking parchment. Sit on a baking sheet and set aside.","Now make the sponge. It is easiest to use a food mixer set with a beater attachment for this, but you can also do it by hand. Cream together the butter and sugar until nicely combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each addition. Then fold in the flour until the mixture is uniform and smooth. Divide the mixture evenly between the tins, spreading it out smoothly with the back of a spoon. Bake for 18-20 minutes.","Meanwhile, prepare the chocolate shards. Cut out a 28x33cm/11x13in piece of baking parchment and place it on a baking sheet. Melt the chocolate either in a bowl sitting on top of a pan of simmering water (do not allow the bowl to touch the water) or in 30 second blasts in the microwave, stirring between each go. Once melted, stir the chocolate until smooth and then pour it onto the centre of the prepared baking parchment. Pop a tiny dot of melted chocolate under each corner of the paper to stick it to the baking sheet and prevent it from moving about. Using a palette knife, spread the chocolate all over the paper right out to the edges in a smooth, even layer. Pop in the fridge for 30 minutes, or until set firm. ","Meanwhile, prepare the icing. (Again this can be done in a food mixer set with the beater attachment or by hand.) Give the butter a quick beat to loosen it and then add the icing sugar and lemon and lime zests. Beat together until fully combined, smooth and creamy in texture. Set aside until ready to use.","To check the cakes are cooked, insert a skewer into the centre of the cakes – if they are cooked it will come out clean. Once baked, remove from the oven and set aside to cool completely.","Remove the set chocolate from the fridge once firm. Dip a long, sharp knife into really hot water and wipe dry. Run the knife under the paper to release it from the tray and then cut the chocolate into twelve 11x7cm/4¼x2¾in rectangles. Carefully peel each one from the backing paper and lay on a clean board. Trim any ragged edges to neaten the shards up. Then make a cut on the diagonal about 3cm/1¼in down one long side for a nice decorative finish. If the shards feel like they are getting too soft at any point return them to the fridge briefly until hardened. Likewise, if they are shattering when being cut, it means they are too hard and brittle and so leave them to warm to room temperature before continuing. Return the prepared shards to the fridge until needed.","Once cooled, remove the cakes from the tins and peel the paper away. Spread a small dot of buttercream icing onto the centre of a serving plate or cake stand. Sit one cake half on top to stick and then spread the top of this evenly with a third (about 200g/7oz) of the buttercream icing. Sit the remaining cake on top to sandwich the filling and then spread the remaining buttercream icing all over the top and sides of the cake evenly. It doesn’t have to look perfect as the whole cake will soon be covered with chocolate shards and fruit.","To decorate, stick a shard, pointed side up and nicest side out, against the side of the cake, starting at one edge. Then add another, overlapping it slightly over the first. Then add a third in the same way to complete one side. Repeat to use up all the shards and cover all sides of the cake. ","Scatter the mango pieces in a single layer all over the top of the cake. Sprinkle over the coconut and lime zest (if using) and it is ready to serve. If not serving straight away, this is best kept in the fridge to prevent the shards from melting. It can be prepared up to a day in advance."],"url":"www_bbc_co_uk_food_recipes_mango_and_white_61987","title":"Mango and white chocolate cake with toasted coconut","time":{"preparation":"less than 30 mins","preparationMins":30,"cooking":"30 mins to 1 hour","cookingMins":60,"totalMins":90},"serves":"Serves 10","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_448/recipes/mango_and_white_61987_16x9.jpg","isVegetarian":true,"recommendations":0}

Open out the chicken and place it on the board so the breast side is facing upwards. ","Press down heavily with the palms of your hands to break the breastbone and flatten the chicken as evenly as possible. This will help it cook more quickly.

","Spoon over the marinade and really massage it into the chicken on both sides, ensuring that every bit of bird is well coated – get your hands in there and really go for it.

","Roast for 1-1¼ hours until the chicken is lightly browned and cooked throughout, tossing the lime quarters on to the rack for the last 20 minutes to cook alongside the chicken.

{"ingredients":["500g/1lb 2 oz Seville oranges","50ml/2 fl oz lemon juice","1kg/2lb 4 oz white sugar: regular, not with added pectin","soft dark brown sugar, optional"],"method":["Weigh the oranges and make a note of the weight, as this will tell you how much of the other ingredients you’ll need, to ensure the marmalade sets well. My basic ratio is: both the sugar and the strained liquid from the sliced and simmered oranges should roughly equal twice the weight of the uncooked whole oranges. So if you start with 500g/1lb 2 oz whole oranges, after cooking you want to be left with a litre/1¾ pint of liquid once the peels have been strained out, and you need 1kg/2lb 4 oz of sugar. ","Cut the oranges in half and squeeze out the juice, as this makes chopping the peel less messy. Remove any pips from the juice, spoon any remaining pips out of the peel, place them in a tea cup and cover with water. Then chop the peel into shreds about 0.25cm/⅛in across and place these in a bowl with the juice and cover with water. Leave both overnight, as this will help the marmalade set well.","The next day, place the peel and water in a saucepan. Sieve the pips, place their soaking water (which will have jellied slightly) into the saucepan, then tie the pips in muslin and drop this into the pot. Bring to the boil then simmer for 2-3 hours, topping up with water so that the fruit stays well covered, until the peel is soft when squished between your fingers. Alternatively, cook in a pressure cooker for about 30 minutes.","Strain the juice from the peel and measure it. Whatever the original weight of fruit was at the beginning, you want about double that in cooking liquid. So if you started with 500g/1lb 2 oz fruit, then try and have roughly a litre/1¾ pint (in other words 1000ml or 1000g) of cooking liquid left. If you have more, boil it down in a saucepan to intensify it. If you have less, top it up with water to dilute it.","Then add the sugar (double the weight of the oranges), plus 1-2 tbsp brown sugar if you like to make the colour darker. Add the strained peel, plus 50ml/2 fl oz of lemon juice for every 500g/1lb 2 oz uncooked whole oranges used. Bring to the boil, skim off any white froth and pips that rise to the surface, and then boil until the temperature reaches 105C/220F.","Meanwhile sterilise enough jars in the oven and have the lids washed and ready. When the marmalade reaches 105C/220F, turn the heat off and leave for 10 minutes. Ladle the marmalade into a jug then pour this carefully into the jars, leaving just a bare 0.5cm/¼in gap at the top.

Now heat a teaspoon of the olive oil in a frying pan and, when it's hot, throw in the mushrooms and toss them around by shaking the pan. Don't worry that there is so little oil, because the mushrooms give off masses of juice once the heat gets to them. Season with salt and pepper, then turn the heat down to very low and just let the mushrooms cook gently, uncovered, so that all the juice evaporates and the flavour of the mushrooms becomes more concentrated. Leave them like that for 30 minutes, stirring them around once or twice.","While they are cooking, cut two-thirds of the cheese into ¼ inch (5mm) cubes and grate the other third on the coarse blade of the grater. After that, break the eggs into a large bowl, whisk lightly with a fork and season well with salt and pepper.

Place the rest of the mushrooms in a bowl covered with foil and keep them warm in the oven, along with the plates.","Now wipe the pan clean with some kitchen paper and put it back on a medium heat, add the rest of the olive oil and, when it's hot, swirl it around the pan.

Scatter the remaining cooked mushrooms over the top of the frittata and cut it into four wedges.

The easiest is to pop them into a bowl, cover them with cold water and leave them overnight or for a minimum of 8 hours. But, if it slips your mind, what you can do is place them in a saucepan, cover them with cold water and bring them up to the boil for 10 minutes. Then turn off the heat and let them soak for 3 hours. Either way, when you want to start making this recipe, the chickpeas need to be simmered for 20 minutes or until tender.","While they're simmering, place a small frying pan over direct medium heat, add the cumin and coriander seeds and toss them around in a hot pan for about 2-3 minutes or until they start to dance and change colour. Then remove the seeds to a pestle and mortar and crush them coarsely and transfer them to a plate. Next, crush the saffron stamens to a powder with the pestle and mortar, then squeeze out the juice of one of the lemons and add it to the saffron, stirring well.","Then prepare the chicken by seasoning the joints with salt and pepper. Slice the peppers in half, remove the seeds and pith and cut each half intolarge pieces. The onions should be sliced roughly the same size as the peppers. Now heat 1 tbsp of the olive oil in the flameproof casserole and, when it's really hot, brown the chicken pieces on all sides - don't overcrowd the pan; it's best to do it in two batches, four pieces at a time.","After that, remove the chicken pieces to a plate, then add the second tablespoon of oil and turn the heat to its highest setting. When the oil is really hot, add the peppers and onions and cook them in the hot oil, moving them around until their edges are slightly blackened - this should take about 5 minutes - then turn the heat down. Strip the coriander leaves from the stalks, wrap them in a piece of clingfilm and keep them in the fridge. Then chop the coriander stalks finely and add these to the peppers and onions, along with the garlic, chillies, crushed spices, the chickpeas and rice, then give everything a good stir to distribute all the ingredients.","Season well with salt and pepper, then combine the lemon and saffron mixture with the stock and wine, pour it all in to the casserole and stir well. Cut the remaining lemon into thin slices and push these well into the liquid. Now scatter the olives in and, finally, place the pieces of chicken on top of everything.
