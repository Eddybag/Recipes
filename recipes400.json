Break up the gingernut biscuits in a food processor to give fine crumbs. Mix well into the melted butter and then tip into the bottom of the prepared tin.

", "Sit on a baking tray and pop into the oven for 40-45 minutes. The cheesecake should be just set with a little wobble. When it reaches this stage, turn off the oven and leave to cool in there for about an hour. This (usually) stops the cheesecake from cracking. Also avoid moving the cheesecake around at this stage to help prevent cracking. However, don\u2019t worry if it does crack as it will still taste delicious and will be nicely decorated.", "Once it has had an hour of cooling, remove the cheesecake from the oven. The cheesecake may still be a little bit warm, so you can either eat it like this or wait and eat it when it is completely cool. Arrange the berries and figs on top, dust with icing sugar and scatter over the mint leaves if using, and serve. The cheesecake will keep for a couple of days, covered in the fridge."]}]
