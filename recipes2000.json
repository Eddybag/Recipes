Finish decorating the ladybird by piping on a face and spots in black icing.", "To decorate the lamb biscuits, ice half the bodies of the lambs using the flooding technique in step 10 - keeping the legs free of icing. Once the icing is dry, spread an undecorated lamb biscuit with icing and sandwich to the back of the decorated biscuit. Dot some icing on the back of the individual lamb legs and stick over the whole lamb\u2019s legs to give a 3D effect. When the icing is dry the biscuits should stand up without support. If desired, decorate the lamb\u2019s legs with icing.\r\n \r\n", "To decorate the sitting down person biscuits, decorate the biscuit bodies as desired.
